### Notice

## To Do - Ideas

- Better solution to [#6](https://github.com/JohnTheGr8/Wox.Plugin.Spotify/issues/6)
- Search user content (playlists, saved music)
- Configurable default search type (now track search is default, album/playlist search might be more suitable to some)
- User Configuration (#1)
- Clear Cache folder
